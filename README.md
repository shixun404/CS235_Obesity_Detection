# CS235_Obesity_Detection
## Intro
Obesity is a common health issue. It is related to multiple factors, including eating habits, physical conditions, and other variables.
Predicting obesity from tens of attributes is a challenging task.
Given real-world obesity data, we employ five data mining techniques to predict whether a person will develop obesity or not.
The input have $14$ attributes, including eating habits, physical conditions and other variables, as shown in Table \ref{tab:obesity}.
We choose five classification methods: perceptron, logistic regression, naive Bayes, ID3 decision tree, and CART decision tree.
Accuracy, precision, recall and F1 are our performance metric.

## Methods
- Perceptron
- Logistic regression
- Naive Bayes
- ID3 decision tree
- CART decision tree
